EMIC-Induced Precipitation as Measured by ELFIN: Source Regions, Impacts, and Energy Dependence

Energetic electron precipitation (EEP) is the process by which radiation belt electrons collide with the Earth's atmosphere, causing ionization and a multitude of follow-on effects. Characterization of the causes and effects of this process is crucial to accurately modelling climate and developing space weather mitigation systems. At high orbits, however, EEP fluxes are very difficult to estimate, as the loss cone is only a few degrees wide and is not able to be resolved by current instrumentation. This has led to poor characterization of precipitation rates and pitch angle distributions within the loss cone. With the launch of the Electron Losses and Fields Investigation (ELFIN) mission, however, observations within the loss cone are now viable. ELFIN monitored electron fluxes from Low Earth Orbit, where the loss cone is large, providing 22.5ยบ angular resolution inside the ~67ยบ loss cone, allowing for an unprecedented look at EEP dynamics. 

This poster utilizes ELFIN's data to characterize EEP driven by electromagnetic ion-cyclotron (EMIC) waves. EMIC waves are an important driver of relativistic EEP from the outer radiation belt via pitch angle scattering into the loss cone, but the exact nature of their interactions with relativistic electrons remains poorly-characterized. ELFIN's high energy and angular resolution provides an opportunity to quantify the nature of EMIC-electron interactions, as well as estimate the rate and location of EMIC-induced precipitation (EIP).

An in-progress algorithm for the detection of EIP is used to create a set of 237 candidate EIP events in ELFIN's data. The magnetospheric source and atmospheric deposition regions of these events are characterized along with their distributions in pitch angle-energy space, and the energy profile of EMIC-electron scattering is roughly estimated, showing consistency with previous results.
